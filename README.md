USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Based off of https://github.com/divingmule/plugin.video.theblaze

This also uses a modified (included in the resources directory) version of http://github.com/thegryghost/mlb-hls-nexdef which must be built and placed in your path.

This is currently in a very hackish state using a cache file that isn't automatically cleaned up after execution, but it does work.  May require mplayer2 as an external player.
